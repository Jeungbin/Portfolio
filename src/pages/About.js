            <p>
              I majored in business administration and studied marketing at
              university. <br />
              While studying at university, I worked part-time as an English and
              Korean teacher at a small academy. Due to COVID-19, the number of
              students at the academy has decreased significantly.
              <br />I realized that We should start online education. I designed
              the website with Figma, And I made the website to use the WIX.
              <br></br> I worked as a web designer for a year. I was interested
              in web design and development and I am studying hard to become a
              web developer.
